Please transform these notes into a structured technical roadmap with priorities, dependencies, and estimated effort.
```

## üé® Customizing AI Behavior

### Local AI Configuration

**Adjust Model Parameters**:
```json
{
  "temperature": 0.3,     // Lower = more consistent
  "max_tokens": 1000,     // Response length limit  
  "top_p": 0.9,          // Creativity vs accuracy
  "frequency_penalty": 0.1 // Reduce repetition
}
```

**Model Selection**:
- **Llama 3.1 8B**: Fast, good for basic tasks
- **Llama 3.1 70B**: Slower, better quality for complex tasks
